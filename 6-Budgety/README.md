# Budget Application

It is a project from an Udemy course (Javascript: The complete course). The application is build in Vanilla Javascript. 
For better workflow and learning purposes, I went ahead and added Gulp and Browserify. The code in javascript was getting to big to be maintainable. I broke down into modules with Browserify.
