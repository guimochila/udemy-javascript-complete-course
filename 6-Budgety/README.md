# Budget Application

It is a project from an Udemy course (Javascript: The complete course). The application is build in Vanilla Javascript. 
For better workflow and learning purposes, I'm improving the code and the workflow with Gulp and Browserify. Probably ES2015 will be added.
I created a new repository for the new code: https://github.com/guimochila/budget-js-app
